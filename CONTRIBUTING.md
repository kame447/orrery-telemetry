## Test environment

`packages/agentstack_mail` has real dependencies (fastmcp, sqlmodel,
python-decouple, …), so a bare `python3 -m pytest` cannot even collect its
tests. Create the repo-local venv once and run the suite from it:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e packages/agentstack_mail pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-timeout pytest-xdist
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -n auto --dist loadfile
```

`.venv/` is gitignored. Do not install anything into a service venv under
`~/.agentstack/` — those are production artifacts whose contents are pinned
by cutover receipts.

The full suite is about 1,650 tests. Serially it takes 20 minutes on a
laptop; most of that is a long tail of installer and service rehearsals that
each spawn real processes, not any one slow test. `-n auto --dist loadfile`
runs files on parallel workers (6 minutes with six) while keeping the tests
of one file together, since files share fixtures and fake homes. Every run
prints its 25 slowest tests; a test over 120 s is failed by `pytest-timeout`
(both set in `pytest.ini`). Before calling a test "environment-dependent",
note that `tests/conftest.py` strips `AGENTSTACK_*` from the environment for
the whole session, so a shell started by an installed stack runs the suite
the way CI does.

Caveats learned by measurement:

- Do not pipe pytest through `tail` without `pipefail`: the pipeline exits
  with `tail`'s status and a red suite reads as exit 0. Do not cut the
  output with `tail -3` either: the FAILED lines above the summary are the
  part that says what to fix.
- Run the suite without other heavy processes (or a second concurrent
  pytest): the SIGKILL-timing parity tests in
  `packages/agentstack_mail/tests/test_pending_decision_d8_d9.py` can fail
  under CPU contention and pass in a clean single run.
- A test that starts a daemon must stop it in `finally`, on every path. A
  run that is interrupted or times out otherwise leaves the daemon behind;
  `ps -eo pid,command | grep pytest-of-` after a run should print nothing.

## Regression priority: a truly fresh install first

The first environment this project protects is a machine with no existing
ORRERY Mail database, virtual environment, or running service. Keeping an
existing installation working alongside local state is important, but it comes
second. A change that passes only by reusing a developer's machine is not done.

Installer tests construct isolated homes, fake external commands, and local
HTTP servers so the complete bundled-service path is exercised without reading
or changing a developer's production state. The package service tests cover
real process startup and message persistence from the repository-local venv.

## Docs Definition Of Done

When a change modifies behavior, startup flow, install behavior, or agent
coordination rules, review the docs in the same PR before calling the work
done:

- `README.md` and `README.en.md` (the English quick start and document table
  must list the same steps and guides as the Japanese original)
- `AGENTS.md` (the instructions an installing agent follows)
- `docs/install.md`, `docs/hooks.md` and the reference the change touches
- `claude/CLAUDE.md`
- `codex/AGENTS.md`

Facts that drift silently — the default ORRERY Mail port, the number of
approval prompts, the number of Claude event hooks, the guide list — are
checked against the implementation by `tests/test_docs_consistency.py`.
Extend that test when you add such a fact instead of relying on review.

The docs must not contradict the implementation. If no docs change is needed,
that should be an explicit review decision, not an accidental omission.

## Shell compatibility (macOS bash 3.2)

The launchers and hooks use `#!/bin/bash`, and macOS ships GNU bash **3.2** as
`/bin/bash`, so they must run correctly there — not only on a newer homebrew
bash. The most common trap is a **self-referencing `local`/`declare`**: bash 4+/5
make an earlier name in the same statement visible to a later initializer, but
bash 3.2 does not, so under `set -u` it aborts with `<name>: unbound variable`.

```bash
# BROKEN on bash 3.2:
local agent_name="$1" state_file="$CHILD_STATE_DIR/$agent_name.json"
# OK — split into two statements:
local agent_name="$1"
local state_file="$CHILD_STATE_DIR/$agent_name.json"
```

Before pushing shell changes, run the tests (pure stdlib, no dependencies):

```bash
for t in tests/test_*.py; do python3 "$t"; done
```

`tests/test_bash32_local_selfref.py` fails the build on any self-referencing
`local`/`declare`. When feasible, also exercise the actual code path on
`/bin/bash` (3.2), not just a newer bash.

## Windows contributions (community lane)

Native Windows is not a supported platform; WSL2 is the Windows path the
maintainer verifies. Windows-native work is still welcome, on one condition:
**it must not be able to change how the macOS install behaves.** The layout
below makes that a property of the tree rather than of each review.

- **Placement.** Windows-only scripts go in `scripts/windows/`, Windows-only
  tests in `tests/windows/` (collected only on `win32`, see its `conftest.py`),
  Windows-only guides as `docs/windows-*.md`. Do not add Windows files next to
  the macOS ones.
- **Shared code.** A change to a shared module (for example `storage.py` or
  `dashboard/server.py`) is acceptable only when the non-Windows path is
  unchanged and the Windows branch is guarded by `sys.platform == "win32"` and
  covered by a test in `tests/windows/`. Say so in the PR description.
- **Off limits without prior discussion in an issue:** `scripts/install.sh`,
  the hooks, launchers, `docs/install.md`, and the README support table. The
  support table stays as it is; a Windows guide may be linked from it in one
  sentence at most.
- **Docs.** Start every `docs/windows-*.md` with a line that says it is
  community-maintained and experimental, and list what was actually run
  (Windows build, Python, shell). Do not write "supported".
- **CI.** The `portable startup (Windows)` job runs `tests/windows/` plus the
  portable startup tests. The macOS matrix ignores `tests/windows/`, so a red
  Windows job never blocks a macOS fix and a macOS change never has to know
  about Windows.
- **Review.** The maintainer reviews Windows PRs for the boundary above, not
  for Windows correctness; the contributor's own validation log in the PR is
  the evidence. Keep one concern per PR (see #7 for the shape that merges
  quickly).

## Dashboard UI changes

The dashboard has a design language, and it is the maintainer's, not a
matter of taste per PR. Read [docs/design.en.md](docs/design.en.md)
([日本語](docs/design.md)) before touching `dashboard/index.html`,
`theme_light.css`, or anything the page renders, and before asking an AI to
build UI for it. Compose new elements from the tokens, the two typefaces, and
the hierarchy described there; a new hue, a new face, or a literal colour is a
regression. If what you need does not fit, open an issue with a screenshot
before writing code. Include dark and light screenshots in the PR (light is
one console call away, see the design document's light-theme section), and
run `scripts/dashboard_theme_manifest.py --write` then `--check` after any
CSS change so the embedded theme keeps applying.
