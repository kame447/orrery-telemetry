"""The mail watcher's interrupt threshold.

A notification is typed straight into the recipient's prompt. That is right for
"your child finished", and wrong for the fourth progress note in a minute while
a human is mid-sentence with the parent — a tester running several children at
once reported exactly that. `AGENTSTACK_MAIL_NOTIFY_MIN_IMPORTANCE` sets how
important a message has to be to interrupt.

What it must not do is lose mail. The filter declines to *interrupt*; the
message stays in the inbox for the next `fetch_inbox`. That property lives in
`handle_signal_file` (it records a result and returns without consuming the
signal), and is asserted here by reading the source, because the ordering is
the whole point.
