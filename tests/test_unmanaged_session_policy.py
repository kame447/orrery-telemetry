"""What the guards do when nobody can register, and when nobody claims a session.

A tester reported that an IDE agent panel was refused on its first Edit, with a
message naming a recovery it could not perform: the registration flag has one
writer, the PostToolUse hook on the mail MCP's register_agent, and
`agentstack-reregister` does not write it. The first reading was that the client
was structurally excluded. It was not -- the same client had registered fine on
other days, and what was broken that day was the mail service.

So two questions are asked separately, and this file pins both:

  transport  is the service answering? While it is not, no session can register
             and no reservation can be taken or checked by anyone, so a refusal
             protects nothing that is still alive.
  identity   does this session have an identity source? While the service is
             answering, a session without one can register, so it is asked to.

Conflating them made the guards decide by launch path: a healthy server still
waved raw clients through, and an outage still trapped tmux ones.
