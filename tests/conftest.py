"""Session-wide safety net: the suite must not stop the machine's own services.

tests/test_mail_autostart.py ran `agentstack-mailctl stop` without naming a
label. The controller defaults to the production one, so every full-suite run
booted out the developer's real mail service. Each occurrence was investigated
as an outage in its own right -- five in one day -- before the pattern showed
up, and one of those investigations reported the supervisor as broken for
failing to recover from a stop nothing had explained.

A textual rule ("every test that runs mailctl must set a label") is easy to
satisfy without being true: the offending file already contained a test label,
in an unrelated string. This watches the service instead.

Comparing before and after is not enough either -- a test that stops the
service and starts it again leaves the same end state while every agent on the
machine loses its coordination for the duration. So this samples throughout.
