"""`agentstack-mailctl` must be able to manage a launchd-supervised server.

Reported by a tester on 2026-08-17: `status`, `stop` and `restart` all died with
"endpoint is occupied without a live managed pid" against a healthy server. The
plist runs `agentstack-mail-service foreground ...` directly, while the
controller only recognises a process started through `run-agentstack-mail.sh`,
so its ownership guard could never match the launchd instance and the documented
CLI was unusable -- operators had to fall back to raw launchctl.

The controller now defers to launchd where launchd is the supervisor. Signalling
launchd's child behind its back is what made "who supervises this" ambiguous in
the first place.
