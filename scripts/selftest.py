"""Prove the installed stack works, rather than that its parts are present.

``agentstack-doctor`` answers "is it there?". Every failure this project has
shipped to a tester answered that question with yes: a launchd job registered
but dead, a database path recorded but absent, a dashboard installed but
holding a stale process. So this asks the other question — put two agents in
the system, have them find each other, exchange messages, take a lock, and
check that the dashboard can see all of it.

Nothing here uses a private path. It talks to the same ORRERY Mail endpoint the
hooks use and reads the same HTTP API the browser reads, because a self-test
that runs somewhere the product does not is a test of the self-test.
