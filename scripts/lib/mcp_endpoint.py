"""Whether two ORRERY Mail MCP URLs reach the same server.

This lives on its own because three places need the same answer: the installer
decides whether rewriting `~/.claude.json` would be churn, doctor decides
whether to tell the user delegation is broken, and selftest decides whether to
fail the run. When only the installer knew that `/api/` and `/mcp` are the same
door, the other two reported a working configuration as missing and as a hard
failure.

ORRERY Mail mounts its MCP app at both `/api` and `/mcp` no matter which one is
configured as the base ("compatibility aliases ... regardless of configured
base" in its http.py). Verified against a running server: POST to either
returns 200.
