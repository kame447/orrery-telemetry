# Published after the cutover, deliberately kept out of the two sets above.
#
# Those sets record what the frozen predecessor exposed; growing either one
# would claim this tool was part of that surface, which it was not. This set
# says the true thing instead: the surface gained a tool, on a date, for a
# reason, and the ledger of intentional differences carries the rest.
#
# unretire_agent is here because retirement had become one-way in practice. A
# session ending outside tmux could resolve an unrelated live agent's name and
# retire it (two agents lost that way on 2026-08-27), and nothing on the
# published surface could undo it: register_agent does not clear retired_at,
# and the tool that does was excluded as "not in the predecessor". Recovery
# meant editing the database by hand, which is the worst tool to reach for
# during an incident.

# project before they release, retire, or type into a pane, and the tokenless
# directory read cannot answer that. The ordinary lookup is unchanged, so this
# only adds a property; the ledger entry is
# post_cutover_intentional_differences[surface.tool.whois.registration_token].
