"""ASGI path-alias rewriting for the ORRERY Mail HTTP endpoint.

The retired third-party server answered the MCP endpoint on both ``/mcp`` and
``/api/``, and shell helpers, ``install.sh``, and MCP client configs split
between the two. Serving only one path turned every caller on the other path
into a silent 404 (the 2026-08-12 cutover broke child spawning exactly this
way). This middleware restores the old contract: well-known alias paths are
rewritten onto the canonical endpoint before routing, so the FastMCP app keeps
a single mount and the lifespan/SIGTERM contract in :mod:`boundary` is
untouched.

The rewrite targets the canonical path exactly as configured. That matters
because the underlying Starlette mount is trailing-slash exact: with
``path=/api/`` the app serves 200 on ``/api/`` but 307 on ``/api``, and a
plain ``curl`` caller does not follow redirects — so rewriting an alias to the
redirecting form would trade a 404 for an empty-body 307 and stay broken.
