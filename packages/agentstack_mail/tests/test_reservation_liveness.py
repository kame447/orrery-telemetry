"""The staleness sweep must not take reservations away from a working agent.

Two independent defects let it do exactly that, both observed in production on
2026-08-16 (5,058 of 12,699 reservations in the live database were released
within 120s of being granted, across five agents and several days):

1. ``last_active_ts`` was refreshed only by ``register_agent`` and by sending a
   message. An agent that reserved, renewed, and released files for an hour
   without mailing anyone looked idle after 30 minutes.
2. A pattern that matched no file on disk was treated as evidence of an idle
   holder -- indistinguishable from a file that exists and is old. The single
   most common reservation ("I am about to create this note") has nothing to
   stat until the write lands, so it was swept ~1s after grant and the write
   was then blocked for holding no reservation.

The fixes for both are load-bearing in ways a naive test misses, so the cases
below also pin the *order* of the liveness bump against the sweep, and the
point at which an unmatched pattern stops being given the benefit of the doubt.
