# Installation

[Back to README](../README.en.md) · [Next: Launchers and identity](launchers.en.md)

This document is for people installing ORRERY Telemetry (this repository) for the first time. It takes three commands to install, two to verify, and one to start the first agent. Migration instructions for previous users of the third-party MCP Agent Mail are collected in the [appendix](#appendix-for-previous-mcp-agent-mail-users) at the end.

## Supported environment

macOS is the primary target. The launchers and hooks are implemented to work with the system Bash 3.2 on macOS.

Required:

- Python 3.11 or newer (`python3`). The full suite has been measured on 3.12 / 3.13 / 3.14. There is no upper bound (CI runs 3.11, 3.12, and 3.14 every time, so incompatibility with a newer Python will fail there)
- `tmux`
- `git`
- `uv` (used to create the Python environment for the bundled ORRERY Mail)
- Claude Code or Codex CLI. Keep Codex CLI current (`npm install -g @openai/codex@latest`). An old release (seen with 0.153.4) has GPT-6 models rejected for a ChatGPT account with `model is not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account` (0.158.0 worked). `agentstack-doctor` prints a note for releases older than 0.157

Optional:

- `fswatch`: mail watcher. Falls back to polling every two seconds when absent; notifications still arrive. The watcher itself is registered by the installer as a launchd / systemd service, so notifications are delivered no matter where an agent was started from
- `fzf`: directory picker for a launcher without arguments. The current directory is used when absent
- Ghostty: click-to-jump and window titles. Falls back to iTerm2, Terminal.app, or `none`. Only Ghostty can raise an existing window; iTerm2 and Terminal.app open a new window for every jump
- Obsidian: vault / Daily Note integration for `/log` and links that open Output items inside a vault. `/log`'s Obsidian mode is enabled only when `AGENTSTACK_OBSIDIAN_APP` is set; the installer does not set it. Without it, `/log` writes to local `logs/`, and the dashboard displays a generic project log as a non-link item

On macOS, the resident-service path is chosen by the actual result of bootstrapping into launchd's `gui/$UID` domain. If bootstrap is unavailable while the display sleeps, in an SSH-only environment, or for another reason, installation automatically switches to supervised-background mode, which detects and restarts an exited dashboard server. On Linux, the implementation uses a systemd user service or the same supervised-background mode when unavailable, but it is unverified on a plain Linux host; CI only tests unit generation with a stubbed `systemctl`. On WSL2 (Ubuntu 26.04 / WSL 2.7) the install, Mail, dashboard, `agent-start`, `/delegate` children, and dashboard jump (attach / resume in a Windows Terminal tab) have been checked on a real machine. For what happens when the Ubuntu windows close, and `wsl --shutdown`, see the WSL2 section of [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.en.md). Native Windows is unsupported.

An explicitly specified `AGENTSTACK_PYTHON` is also checked for Python 3.11 or newer. When unspecified, the installer checks `python3` on PATH, then also searches versioned commands, `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`, and `/usr/local/bin/python3` if needed. If no compatible interpreter exists, it reports the inspected versions and paths and stops before generating service files.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gyroid-eth/orrery-telemetry.git
cd orrery-telemetry
./scripts/install.sh --project-key /absolute/path/to/your-project
```

Pass the absolute path of the project where agents will work to `--project-key`, not the checkout of this repository. It is required on first install, and the installer stops without writing anything if it is omitted. Later installations inherit the previous value from `~/.agentstack/env.sh`, so it can be omitted.

The installer previews three changes and asks for `yes` for each.

1. Claude Code MCP registration (add `orrery-mail` to `~/.claude.json`)
2. Claude Code settings (append hooks and permissions to `~/.claude/settings.json`)
3. Managed instruction blocks (between markers in the project's `CLAUDE.md` and `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`)

All existing content is preserved, and a backup from before each merge is stored in `~/.agentstack/backups`. An item answered with `no` can be installed separately later with a helper; see [Using ORRERY Mail from Claude Code](#using-agent-mail-from-claude-code).

The installer places:

- the dashboard, launchers, hooks, skills, bundled ORRERY Mail, `env.sh`, `VERSION`, and `install-state.json` under `~/.agentstack/`
- `~/.claude/skills/delegate` and `~/.claude/skills/log`, as symlinks into `~/.agentstack/skills/`
- two resident services: the dashboard on port 8770 and ORRERY Mail at `http://127.0.0.1:18765/mcp`, with state under `~/.agentstack/mail`. Each is registered with launchd on macOS or started in supervised-background mode when registration is unavailable

`env.sh` uses mode `0600` and contains no token. Shell dotfiles are not changed.

### Verification

```bash
~/.agentstack/bin/agentstack-doctor
~/.agentstack/bin/agentstack-selftest
open http://127.0.0.1:8770/
```

`agentstack-doctor` reports separately whether required files and settings are present, whether the dashboard's `/api/version` actually responds, and whether launchd / systemd registration and execution state are healthy. When the endpoint responds but the manager is not running it, the result is `unmanaged-background`.

`agentstack-selftest` registers two real agents, exchanges messages, holds a file reservation, and confirms that the dashboard reads the result from the same database. Run it at least once after installation.

### Starting the first agent

A Claude Code session opened before installation does not rescan newly installed skills. Run `/exit` in the existing session, then start a new terminal and launch with the project path.

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.agentstack/bin:$PATH"
agent-start /path/to/your-project
# Codex CLI なら
agent-start-codex /path/to/your-project
```

`agent-start` creates a tmux session with the same name as the ORRERY Mail identity. Dashboard jumps, mail notifications, and token recovery are joined by this name. In the launched Claude Code session, invoke skills with a leading slash, as in `/delegate`. See [Skills and file reservations](launchers.en.md#skills-2-and-file-reservations) for the first child launch.

## Installing on Windows (WSL2)

On Windows, install inside a WSL2 Ubuntu. Inside Ubuntu it is Linux, so the steps above apply unchanged. This is the order that worked on Windows 11 with Ubuntu 26.04 / WSL 2.7.

1. **Install WSL2 and Ubuntu** (PowerShell, once).
   ```powershell
   wsl --update
   wsl --install -d Ubuntu
   ```
   It ends by asking for a username and password. If it stops with an error such as `Wsl/Service/E_UNEXPECTED`, run `wsl --update` first and retry `wsl --install`.
2. **Enter Ubuntu.** Every command below is typed at the Ubuntu prompt (`user@PC:~$`). Typed at the PowerShell prompt (`PS C:\...>`) it fails at the first `&&`.
   ```powershell
   wsl -d Ubuntu
   ```
3. **Install the prerequisites** (inside Ubuntu).
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git tmux python3 curl fswatch
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```
   `fswatch` is optional. Without it the mail watcher falls back to polling every 2 seconds and notifications still arrive.
4. **Clone and run the installer** (inside Ubuntu). Keep the project on the WSL side (`~/work/...`): `/mnt/c` is slow and handles permissions differently.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gyroid-eth/orrery-telemetry.git
   cd orrery-telemetry
   ./scripts/install.sh --project-key ~/work/your-project
   ```
   The questions are the same three as above, and each only changes files under the Ubuntu home. Answer each with `yes` and one press of Enter (over Remote Desktop a key can register as repeated, so press once and wait for the output). It is done when `dashboard healthy: http://127.0.0.1:8770/api/agents` appears.
5. **Open the dashboard.** In a Windows browser open `http://127.0.0.1:8770/`. WSL2 forwards localhost to Windows, so it just works.
6. **Install Claude Code or the Codex CLI inside Ubuntu and log in.** A copy installed on the Windows side is not used: agents run inside Ubuntu's tmux.
   ```bash
   # Claude Code (native installer; lands in ~/.local/bin)
   curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
   # Codex CLI (needs Node.js; keep the global prefix under home to avoid sudo)
   sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
   npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
   npm install -g @openai/codex@latest
   ```
   Log in with `claude` (then `/login`) and `codex login`. Open the URL each prints in a Windows browser to authorize.
   If Codex is also installed on the Windows side, Ubuntu's PATH shows that Windows `codex` (`/mnt/c/...`) too, and it cannot run inside Ubuntu. The installer skips it and chooses the `codex` installed inside Ubuntu (one that answers `--version`); an agent starting a Codex child with `/delegate` follows the same rules and, when its shell has no `AGENTSTACK_CODEX_BIN`, uses the value the installer saved in `~/.agentstack/env.sh`; re-running it also replaces a Windows `codex` saved by an earlier install. If `agentstack-doctor` prints `warn: Codex launcher binary ... cannot start Codex`, install Codex inside Ubuntu and re-run the installer. The reason comes in two forms. `exited with status N after 0.0s: …` means `codex --version` ended at once with an error, and the line that follows is that error (with `Missing optional dependency …`, the node on that shell's PATH is not the one Codex was installed with: run the installer from a login shell such as `zsh -lc`, or pass `--codex-bin`). `did not finish within 10s and was stopped` means it did not answer in time.
   If Codex was already installed in Ubuntu, update it too with `npm install -g @openai/codex@latest`: with an old release, a child started on a GPT-6 model is rejected by the API (on WSL, 0.153.4 was rejected and 0.158.0 answered).
   If you will use Codex children, after the installer [install the history binding and approve it once in `/hooks`](#using-codex-install-the-history-binding-and-approve-it-once-in-hooks). Without it, starting a Codex child can wait up to about 90 seconds.
7. **Start an agent** (inside Ubuntu). Use the same commands as in "Starting the first agent" above. The dashboard's jump opens a new Windows Terminal (`wt.exe`, preinstalled on Windows 11) tab attached to the tmux session. If Windows Terminal is missing, install it from the Microsoft Store.

**Closing the windows does not stop anything.** After every Ubuntu window is closed, the agents in tmux and the dashboard keep running. When you are done and want WSL to stop, run `wsl --shutdown` in PowerShell. It stops all of WSL at once, other distros included, so first save and close the agents' work and anything else running in WSL. If you use WSL only through the Windows SSH server, it stops about 15 seconds after the last connection closes. See the [WSL2 section of troubleshooting](troubleshooting.en.md#on-wsl2-closing-the-ubuntu-windows).

## Non-interactive installation (`--assume-yes`)

When installing from CI or a script, the four approvals (Claude settings merge, the `~/.claude.json` MCP entry, the Codex `AGENTS.md` block, and the Claude `CLAUDE.md` block) are skipped with warnings by default. The following option may be used only when the **user personally** reviewed the repository and preview and has granted approval in advance.

```bash
./scripts/install.sh --project-key /absolute/path/to/your-project --assume-yes
```

`--assume-yes` (short form `-y`; environment variable `AGENTSTACK_ASSUME_YES=1` is equivalent) grants approvals in advance; it is not `--force`. Python older than 3.11, a dashboard-port conflict, multiple or absent existing ORRERY Mail database candidates, disagreement with the running server, and automatic-setup failure still stop installation. Every automatically approved item is printed separately as an `assume-yes:` line. Agents and automation must not add this option “for convenience” without the user's explicit choice. The command-line option takes precedence over the environment variable and is not persisted in generated `env.sh`.

## Installation tiers and options

| Invocation | Tier | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `./scripts/install.sh` | Tier 1 / default | Install all payloads and Claude skill links. Merge hooks, permissions, and Codex / Claude managed blocks only when approved after preview |
| `./scripts/install.sh --dashboard-only` | Tier 0 | Dashboard and helpers only. Do not install hooks, skills, or Codex / Claude templates |
| `./scripts/install.sh --scoped` | Tier 2 placeholder | Install payloads but do not change user settings / managed documents |
| `./scripts/install.sh --dry-run` | preview | Display planned changes without changing files or services |

`--dashboard-only` and `--scoped` are mutually exclusive. An unknown option or missing value stops before any changes.

```text
--install-dir PATH      default: ~/.agentstack
--project-key PATH      first install: required / re-install: existing env.sh
--port PORT             default: existing env.sh, else 8770
--label-prefix PREFIX   default: existing env.sh, else org.agentstack
--terminal MODE         auto | ghostty | iterm | terminal | none (default: existing env.sh, else auto)
--reset-settings        do not inherit settings from the existing env.sh (see Upgrade)
--spawn-dirs PATHS      NEW AGENT launch-directory presets (`:`-separated)
--spawn-roots PATHS     roots the directory typeahead may browse (`:`-separated)
--codex-approval MODE   Codex child `--ask-for-approval` (never | on-request | on-failure | untrusted; default never)
--codex-network MODE    Codex child sandbox network (on | off; default on)
--codex-add-dirs PATHS  extra writable roots for Codex children (`:`-separated)
--retire-legacy-mail    see the appendix (retire a previous MCP Agent Mail)
--mail auto|update|keep what to do with a running ORRERY Mail (default keep; --update-mail / --keep-mail are aliases)
--update-mail           always replace the running ORRERY Mail with this checkout's build (exit 1 if it cannot; docs/agentstack-mail-update.en.md)
--keep-mail             keep the running ORRERY Mail build (the default; AGENTSTACK_MAIL_UPDATE=auto switches only when it safely can)
--print-mail-plan       print one line saying what would happen to ORRERY Mail, then exit (reads only)
-y, --assume-yes        approval prompts only; validation errors remain fatal
```

An explicit `--project-key` always has highest priority, followed by environment variables `AGENTSTACK_PROJECT_KEY` / `PROJECT_KEY`, then an existing `env.sh` at the install destination. `--spawn-dirs` / `--spawn-roots` follow the same precedence and retain their previous values on reinstall; see “Spawn directory” in [configuration](configuration.en.md). `--bin-dir` is not a public option. The installer calls `agentstack-merge-settings --bin-dir "$INSTALL_DIR/bin"` internally to expand `__AGENTSTACK_BIN_DIR__` in the permissions template.

## Merging settings, permissions, and Claude skills

The Tier 1 merge uses the JSON parser in `scripts/lib/merge_settings.py`.

- Preserve existing hooks, permissions, and other user settings
- Append only ORRERY Telemetry values, without duplicates
- Save a pre-merge settings backup in `~/.agentstack/backups`
- Record added entries and the change result in the manifest
- Idempotently update only content between managed-block markers
- Treat `install-state.json` as canonical for uninstall scope

Permission `deny` entries are limited to **irreversible operations with no recovery mechanism**. Even destructive operations are left out of both allow and deny when they are recoverable, leaving them to runtime human approval. An operation is also not added to deny when the same state can be reached through another allowed tool, because doing so would provide no safety. The current three denied operations are `hard_delete_agent`, `hard_delete_project`, and `purge_old_messages`.

The installer parses and merges structure rather than performing simple string replacement so that reinstall and uninstall do not sweep up user settings.

`skillsDirectories` is not a Claude Code setting, and the installer does not add a new value. Canonical skill payloads remain in `~/.agentstack/skills/<name>`, with absolute symlinks from Claude Code's standard path at `~/.claude/skills/<name>`.

```text
~/.claude/skills/delegate -> ~/.agentstack/skills/delegate
~/.claude/skills/log      -> ~/.agentstack/skills/log
```

An existing symlink to the same ORRERY Telemetry payload is reused and recorded as owned in the manifest. Because the link becomes invalid with the payload, it is removed on uninstall. An existing same-name file, directory, or symlink to another target is preserved with a warning and is not recorded as owned. Uninstall compares the manifest path with the actual symlink target and removes only an owned symlink that points to the ORRERY Telemetry payload. A path replaced by the user with a file or directory, or a retargeted symlink, remains.

On systems where an old installer added `~/.agentstack/skills` to `skillsDirectories`, a reinstall with the Tier 1 settings merge approved removes only that old ORRERY Telemetry entry. Other user values in the same array and all other settings are preserved.

The installer does not change shell dotfiles. Within the project, it updates only content between managed markers in `CLAUDE.md`, and only after a Tier 1 preview is approved; it changes no other file. The default location for Claude Code user settings is `~/.claude/settings.json` and can be changed with `AGENTSTACK_CLAUDE_SETTINGS`.

## Using ORRERY Mail from Claude Code

The `/delegate` skill allows `mcp__orrery-mail__*` tools, and the Claude Code user-scope MCP server name is fixed as **`orrery-mail`**.

The Tier 1 installer parses `mcpServers` in `AGENTSTACK_CLAUDE_JSON` (default `~/.claude.json`) as structure and adds or updates only the following entry, preserving all other servers and project settings.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "orrery-mail": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:18765/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

The diff preview replaces bearer tokens with `<redacted>`. Only an interactive `yes` or a user-explicit `--assume-yes` authorizes an atomic mode-`0600` write, with the original file saved in `~/.agentstack/backups`. A non-interactive unapproved run does not write; the installer and `agentstack-doctor` show safe preview / apply commands. `agentstack-selftest` checks this fixed name, endpoint, and authorization registration in addition to the HTTP server itself.

If registration is absent or you answered `no` during installation, follow the doctor's output to preview it.

```bash
~/.agentstack/bin/agentstack-doctor
```

For Codex children, the launcher automatically generates a child-scoped MCP proxy configuration. To use top-level Codex CLI through `agent-start-codex`, add the following once to `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`. The bootstrap reads `MCP_AGENT_MAIL_TOKEN` into process environment, so the token itself does not need to be stored in TOML.

```toml
[mcp_servers.orrery-mail]
url = "http://127.0.0.1:18765/mcp"
```

The key is fixed as `[mcp_servers.orrery-mail]`.

### Using Codex: install the history binding and approve it once in `/hooks`

When a Codex child starts, the launcher confirms that the child began its first task from that launch's Codex record (rollout). This needs the receipt that the Codex history binding (an optional plugin) leaves at startup. **Without it, starting a Codex child can wait up to about 90 seconds** (a short reply on screen may end the wait early, but that is not the receipt's confirmation of the start, and a long reply can still wait the full 90 seconds). With the receipt in place, both short and long tasks were confirmed in about 7 seconds on a real WSL machine.

The steps are the same on macOS and on WSL (inside Ubuntu).

1. Install the integration (from the repository checkout).

   ```bash
   . "$HOME/.agentstack/env.sh"
   ./scripts/install-codex-app-integration.sh \
     --project-key "$AGENTSTACK_PROJECT_KEY" \
     --agent-mail-url "$AGENTSTACK_MCP_URL"
   ```

   It uses the codex the core installer saved in `~/.agentstack/env.sh` (on WSL it never picks the Windows `codex`). Outside macOS it does not install the resident Bridge service and prints `Bridge service: not installed`; the history binding for Codex children does not need that service.
2. Start Codex with the codex the installer chose, and open `/hooks`. At the end the installer prints the command for this on the line after `Next: start Codex with the codex this installer used:`. Normally it is:

   ```bash
   "$AGENTSTACK_CODEX_BIN" -C "$AGENTSTACK_PROJECT_KEY"
   ```

   Do not use a bare `codex`: on WSL the first `codex` on PATH is often the Windows install, which cannot run inside Ubuntu. `/hooks` lists the hooks that need review, for example `⚠ 6 hooks need review`.

   ![/hooks before approval](images/codex-hooks-review.png)

3. Check them, then approve (`t` trusts all). SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit and PostToolUse become Active.

   ![/hooks after approval](images/codex-hooks-after-trust.png)

4. Quit that `codex`. The approval applies to Codex processes started afterwards, not to Codex children already running.

`agentstack-doctor` shows whether the history binding plugin is installed and enabled. It cannot read whether the hooks are approved, so check that in `/hooks`. For details see [Codex App integration](codex-app.en.md).

### Managed instruction helper

The helpers used by Tier 1 to preview / merge can also run independently.

```bash
~/.agentstack/bin/agentstack-codex-setup --print
~/.agentstack/bin/agentstack-claude-setup --print
```

`--print` only displays the target and the block with placeholders resolved; it makes no changes. With no arguments, the helper backs up the existing file and installs / updates only the ORRERY Telemetry block between markers.

```bash
~/.agentstack/bin/agentstack-codex-setup
~/.agentstack/bin/agentstack-claude-setup
```

`--check` compares the block already in each target with the block the installed template renders now, and changes nothing. It reports `ok` only when the text between the markers matches; otherwise it says whether the block differs (older instructions, or edited by hand), is missing, or has broken markers, and prints the exact command that updates it, with the resolved `CODEX_HOME` / scope. Text outside the markers is not compared. `agentstack-doctor` and the end of the installer use this same check. When you skip the managed setup, the installer ends with `Runtime updated; managed instructions differ` and those commands: agents started after that still read the old block until you run them.

```bash
~/.agentstack/bin/agentstack-codex-setup --check
~/.agentstack/bin/agentstack-claude-setup --check
```

Use `--uninstall` on each helper to remove only its block. Codex targets `$CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md`; Claude targets the `CLAUDE.md` selected by `AGENTSTACK_CLAUDE_MD_SCOPE=project / global / both`. Existing content outside the markers is preserved.

## ORRERY Mail service handling

The bundled ORRERY Mail runs with `AGENTSTACK_MAIL_AGENT_NAME_ENFORCEMENT_MODE=passthrough`, which registers exactly the identity requested by a launcher. Its default endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:18765/mcp`, and its state root is `~/.agentstack/mail`. It does not use an HTTP bearer; each agent's owner token is handled through a tool argument / local proxy.

If something already responds at the endpoint, the installer reuses it only when it is ORRERY Mail returning the same database. A listener returning another database is not reused, and installation stops before the first write. In a fresh environment, the installer places the bundled package's virtual environment under a candidate ID, initializes empty state, and continues only after confirming that the health response returns the configured database; see the [agentstack-mail document](agentstack-mail.en.md) for the internal structure.

The following controller operates the service. The runner restarts itself five seconds after a crash, while the controller checks the PID file, endpoint, and database and refuses duplicate startup or stopping an unrelated process.

```bash
~/.agentstack/bin/agentstack-mailctl start
~/.agentstack/bin/agentstack-mailctl status
~/.agentstack/bin/agentstack-mailctl stop
~/.agentstack/bin/agentstack-mailctl restart
```

Even if dashboard service registration or a health check fails, payload generation, approved managed blocks, and `install-state.json` still complete; the installer finishes by showing a warning and the manual command for supervised background. If mail-service provisioning or database health fails, installation stops. Check the actual dashboard residency mode with `~/.agentstack/dashboard/agentctl.sh status` and `agentstack-doctor`.

## VERSION

The repository-root `VERSION` is canonical. The installer copies it into the install root.

`GET /api/version` resolves the version in this order:

1. `VERSION` adjacent to the installed artifact
2. Repository `VERSION`
3. `git describe --tags --always --dirty`
4. `unknown`

Do not copy only the dashboard HTML; update `VERSION` through the installer as well. This keeps the distributed artifact and displayed version consistent.

## macOS TCC / Full Disk Access

`~/Desktop`, `~/Documents`, and `~/Downloads` are protected by macOS TCC. If a root agent starts from a terminal without Full Disk Access, that terminal identity propagates to tmux and its descendants, and only a child agent may encounter `EPERM`.

Remedies:

1. Start the root agent from a terminal with Full Disk Access
2. Or move the project outside protected locations
3. After changing context, recreate the existing tmux server / session

The launcher warns about this state. If needed:

```bash
export AGENTSTACK_TCC_GUARD=0
export AGENTSTACK_TCC_DIRS="$HOME/Desktop:$HOME/Documents:$HOME/Downloads"
```

The canonical `AGENTSTACK_TCC_DIRS` syntax is colon-separated. Legacy whitespace-separated values without a colon remain accepted for compatibility.

Do not attempt to repair these permission errors only with `chmod`. The deciding identity is the originating application, not the file mode.

## Upgrade

Finish work or release active file reservations before updating protection settings; restart affected sessions together after the update. Preview the selected roots first.

```bash
git pull
./scripts/install.sh --dry-run
./scripts/install.sh
~/.agentstack/bin/agentstack-doctor
```

The installer updates payloads and `VERSION`, reregisters services, and previews managed merges again. It validates and reuses the bundled ORRERY Mail candidate and state.

### Reservation protection migration

Each new managed AI launch protects its physical Git worktree root (the working directory outside Git), preceded by ordered `AGENTSTACK_EXTRA_PROTECTED_ROOTS`. Namespace selection and the installed project key are unchanged. Install/update automatically selects process extras (including empty), installed extras (including empty), then the installed legacy `AGENTSTACK_PROTECTED_ROOTS` literal value and order exactly once, then empty. It never imports ambient shell/tmux legacy roots. The installer shows the source, value, and destination in `--dry-run` and stops before overwrite if legacy configuration is invalid or ambiguous.

An empty extras marker is persisted, so an old list cannot be imported again. The old installed field is retained only for direct/unmanaged-hook compatibility; managed launches ignore it. A different nonempty shell/tmux legacy value still warns even when extras exist. `--reset-settings` keeps extras; `AGENTSTACK_EXTRA_PROTECTED_ROOTS=` deliberately clears them. Finish work or release active reservations before cutover, then restart affected sessions together after updating: relative reservation names use the first matching root. See [configuration and migration](configuration.en.md#reservation-protection-and-migration).

### What a re-install inherits

A re-install decides each setting in this order:

1. an explicit value (an option, or an environment variable set when the installer runs)
2. the value the previous install wrote to `~/.agentstack/env.sh`
3. the default

A setting you changed from its default therefore survives `./scripts/install.sh` in a new terminal without the environment variable. This covers the project key and explicit extra protected roots, the dashboard port (`AGENTSTACK_PORT`), the label prefix (`AGENTSTACK_LABEL_PREFIX`) and the ORRERY Mail launchd label derived from it, the terminal, the MCP URL, the service `PATH`, Python, the ORRERY Mail state root (where the database lives), service root and management socket, `AGENTSTACK_LANG` / `AGENTSTACK_MURMUR` / `AGENTSTACK_DELIVERABLE_ROOTS`, `AGENTSTACK_VAULT`, `AGENTSTACK_MANAGED_AGENTS_FILE`, the dashboard log and restart settings (`AGENTSTACK_DASHBOARD_LOG` / `_LOG_MAX_BYTES` / `_LOG_BACKUPS` / `_RESTART_DELAY`), spawn dirs / roots, the worktree root, the Codex child settings, `AGENTSTACK_CODEX_BIN`, portraits and the model catalogs. The canonical list is `AGENTSTACK_INHERITED_SETTINGS` in `hooks/project-context.sh`.

- **Only values you chose are inherited** for ordinary settings. Protection extras use the presence-based migration order above, independently of `AGENTSTACK_CHOSEN_SETTINGS`. `env.sh` writes every value out, defaults included, so it also records which ones were chosen explicitly (`AGENTSTACK_CHOSEN_SETTINGS`), and the next install inherits only those. A value you never chose (a default written out, or the Python and PATH the installer found) follows the new default when a later release changes it. An `env.sh` from an earlier release has no such record; there a value that differs from today's default counts as chosen, except PATH and Python, which the installer always worked out itself. `AGENTSTACK_CODEX_BIN` also inherits the location the installer found (and searches again when it no longer runs).
- To change a previous value, give that option or environment variable explicitly (for example `./scripts/install.sh --port 8771`).
- **To put just one setting back to its default, give it explicitly empty** (for example `AGENTSTACK_VAULT= ./scripts/install.sh` or `./scripts/install.sh --codex-add-dirs ""`).
- To put every chosen value back to its default, pass `--reset-settings` (or `AGENTSTACK_RESET_SETTINGS=1`). Where the data lives, and what the services running on it are called, are inherited even then: the project key, the ORRERY Mail state root, service root and management socket, the label prefix, the ORRERY Mail launchd label and the MCP URL. Resetting those would leave the previous service registered while a second ORRERY Mail, under another name, started on the same database. Give them explicitly to change them (and stop the previous service yourself). Explicit extra protected roots are also kept under reset to avoid silently dropping shared reservations; use `AGENTSTACK_EXTRA_PROTECTED_ROOTS=` to clear them.
- For ordinary settings, an environment variable equal to the value `env.sh` recorded is taken to come from a shell that sourced `env.sh`, or from ORRERY cockpit's update script, not as a new choice: it keeps the status it had, and `--reset-settings` resets it. A value passed as an option is always explicit. Against an `env.sh` from an earlier release, which has no record of choices, an equal value is still explicit, so a value you have always passed is not reset.
- If the Python recorded last time is gone or too old, the installer says so and searches again (an explicit `AGENTSTACK_PYTHON` that cannot be used still stops the install).
- `AGENTSTACK_CLAUDE_JSON` is not inherited. It is an override for installing into a sandbox; the next ordinary install writes `~/.claude.json`.
- The ORRERY Mail service env (`AGENTSTACK_MAIL_ENV`) and database path (`AGENTSTACK_MAIL_DB`) are not inherited settings; they are derived again from the state root and render each time (below).

The start of a dry-run prints the resolved project key, port, label prefix, terminal and MCP URL.

If your shell sources `env.sh` at startup, its `AGENTSTACK_*` values count as explicit. After re-installing from another shell, open a new shell or source `env.sh` again before using a launcher or the installer.

The running ORRERY Mail build stays in use; when it differs from this checkout's build, a `notice:` says so. To replace the build too, add `--update-mail`: the candidate is verified and the database backed up while Mail keeps serving, then the build is switched, and the previous build is put back if the new one does not answer. `AGENTSTACK_MAIL_UPDATE=auto` (opt-in) switches only when it safely can, and otherwise keeps the running build and lets the install succeed. The final `mail-result:` line reports the outcome ([agentstack-mail-update.en.md](agentstack-mail-update.en.md#replacing-the-build-with---update-mail)).

**Keep the ORRERY Mail server running during an in-place upgrade.** The real database path resolved from the running listener takes precedence over filesystem candidate discovery. Stopping ORRERY Mail first falls back to candidate discovery, and the installer stops rather than risk choosing incorrectly in an environment with several databases.

`AGENTSTACK_MAIL_ENV` is a runtime value the installer writes into `env.sh`, which shells read at startup. A render path is derived from the source id and a hash of venv, endpoint and state, so **the value one install writes does not match what the next upgrade expects**. The installer treats an inherited value as unset, and resolves the current render, only when it both **matches the value read out of `env.sh` and sits in this installation's managed render layout** (`<native service root>/renders/<one directory>/service.env`). The waiver prints one line when it applies.

**Equal values cannot prove who set the variable.** To pin a native path across upgrades, set `AGENTSTACK_MAIL_SERVICE_ENV` explicitly: it takes precedence and is never waived. A path outside the managed render layout still stops the installer as before.

If a long-lived shell holds a render from before another shell updated `env.sh`, re-source the installed `env.sh`, or scope the unset to that one command: `env -u AGENTSTACK_MAIL_ENV ./scripts/install.sh`.

If the dashboard port is held by a process under the current ORRERY Telemetry launchd job or supervised-background pidfile, the installer verifies ownership and replaces that dashboard with the new payload. It still stops if an unrelated process holds the same port.

Service environment is written into plist / unit files during installation. Changing only `~/.agentstack/env.sh` does not affect an existing service, so rerun the installer or update the service definition too.

## Uninstall

```bash
~/.agentstack/bin/agentstack-uninstall --dry-run
~/.agentstack/bin/agentstack-uninstall
```

The uninstaller targets only files, services, and settings changes recorded in `install-state.json`.

- Structurally remove merged Claude settings entries
- Remove ORRERY Telemetry-owned files
- Remove only owned directories that become empty
- Preserve ORRERY Mail state / database and the runtime directory (annotations, tokens, session state / logs) by default

Legacy `dashboard/annotations.json` is not included among payload-owned files because it is user state. During upgrade, the installer automatically migrates it to `$AGENTSTACK_RUNTIME_DIR/annotations.json` before copying payloads. It remains in the runtime directory after a normal uninstall.

To remove retained data too:

```bash
~/.agentstack/bin/agentstack-uninstall --purge-data
```

`--purge-data` also targets only exact paths recorded in the manifest; it does not remove a home directory or an unrecorded path. The runtime directory is a purge path, so this option also removes annotations.

## Appendix: for previous MCP Agent Mail users

This section does not apply to first-time users. It is for people who ran the third-party [MCP Agent Mail](third-party.md), on which the bundled ORRERY Mail is based, as their own launchd job.

### Retiring the legacy launchd mail service

When a legacy `mcp_agent_mail` launchd job holds the endpoint, run the installer with explicit `--retire-legacy-mail`. **Before** checking whether it can reuse the existing listener as ORRERY Mail, the installer compares known legacy labels with plist executables, boots out the matching job, and parks its plist in `~/.agentstack/parked-launchd/`. Without the flag, it does not stop the service; it reports the detected label and required flag, then stops.

`--dry-run --retire-legacy-mail` does not actually stop the job, but first displays the retirement plan and then shows the bundled ORRERY Mail provisioning plan under the assumption that the listener will be retired. Repeated legacy scans within the same installer process do not boot out or park the job twice.

If Claude Code's old `mcp-agent-mail` key points to the same endpoint, an approved settings merge moves it to the `orrery-mail` key. An old key pointing to another endpoint remains as an unrelated entry.

### Manual migration of the legacy database

To retain old state (database, archive, and signals), first stop the old writer and confirm all three paths. The installer does not migrate automatically. With the destination still absent, manually run the migration CLI's `copy` and `verify` from the repository checkout, then run the installer.

```bash
LEGACY_DB="/absolute/path/to/the-stopped-legacy-database"
LEGACY_ARCHIVE="/absolute/path/to/the-stopped-legacy-archive"
LEGACY_SIGNALS="/absolute/path/to/the-stopped-legacy-signals"
DESTINATION="$HOME/.agentstack/mail"

uv run --project packages/agentstack_mail agentstack-mail-migrate copy \
  --source-db "$LEGACY_DB" \
  --source-archive "$LEGACY_ARCHIVE" \
  --source-signals "$LEGACY_SIGNALS" \
  --destination-root "$DESTINATION"

uv run --project packages/agentstack_mail agentstack-mail-migrate verify \
  --source-db "$LEGACY_DB" \
  --source-archive "$LEGACY_ARCHIVE" \
  --source-signals "$LEGACY_SIGNALS" \
  --destination-root "$DESTINATION"

./scripts/install.sh
```

The migration helper and service controller reject configurations that share a source and destination database / archive. At the 2026-08-12 cutover, this procedure actually transferred and verified about 60,000 database and archive records in total. Keep the old writer stopped from copy through verify.

### Rollback

The installer does not automatically switch back to the third-party version. If necessary, stop ORRERY Mail and recover manually with the migration and settings backups.
