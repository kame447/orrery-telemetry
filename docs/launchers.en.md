[Previous: Installation](install.en.md) · [Back to README](../README.en.md) · [Next: Delegation and child agents](delegation.en.md)

## Launch commands

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.agentstack/bin:$PATH"

agent-start ~/code/my-project
agent-start-codex ~/code/my-project
agent-start-gemini ~/code/my-project
```

- `agent-start`: Claude Code
- `agent-start-codex`: Codex CLI
- `agent-start-gemini`: Antigravity CLI

If the directory argument is omitted and `fzf` is available, you can select a directory under `AGENTSTACK_BASE_DIR`. Otherwise, the current directory is used.

```bash
export AGENTSTACK_BASE_DIR="$HOME/Obsidian/MyVault"
agent-start
```

The precedence order is an explicit argument, the `fzf` picker, then the current directory.

## Top-level project selection

Before registration, all three top-level launchers print the selected project, where it came from, the working directory, and the reservation-protected roots. Project precedence is `--project-key KEY`, the launching shell's `AGENTSTACK_PROJECT_KEY`, the launching shell's `PROJECT_KEY`, the installed `env.sh`, then the physical launch directory. A project key is a coordination namespace; even a path-shaped key is not proof of repository ownership. The launcher does not switch projects based on the repository. `AGENTSTACK_EXTRA_PROTECTED_ROOTS` contains only deliberately configured extras. Each launch computes runtime `AGENTSTACK_PROTECTED_ROOTS` from those extras in their original order, then the actual worktree root (the working directory for non-Git targets), without duplicates. Relative reservation paths use the first matching root. A project-key path and old computed roots are never treated as extra-root configuration.

```bash
agent-start-codex --project-key "$HOME/shared-vault" ~/code/my-project
```

The shell treats the selected key as opaque namespace data. The bundled Mail service requires an absolute path-shaped human key when creating a project; accepting a logical string during launch resolution does not guarantee that a Mail server will register it. The namespace path need not be the launch repository.

The selected `--project-key` is passed explicitly into a new tmux session even if an existing tmux server carries a different value. To prevent accidental omission, set `AGENTSTACK_REQUIRE_EXPLICIT_PROJECT_KEY=1`; then a top-level launch without `--project-key` stops before registration and prints the required form. This opt-in applies only to `agent-start`, `agent-start-codex`, and `agent-start-gemini`, not to child launches, resume flows, or Dashboard NEW AGENT.

Each launch resolves the actual repository, worktree root, and working directory from the target, exporting `AGENTSTACK_PROJECT_REPOSITORY`, `AGENTSTACK_PROJECT_WORKTREE_ROOT`, and `AGENTSTACK_PROJECT_WORK_DIR`. Linked worktrees share repository identity but retain their separate working directories. A non-Git directory also retains the selected namespace.

Inherited `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, and `GIT_COMMON_DIR` are ignored during resolution and removed from the launched process. Broken Git metadata stops the launch before registration rather than selecting another directory or namespace. Existing tmux server-global state is left untouched; values passed to the new session replace stale workspace context. The three Git selectors are also marked for removal in that newly created session so later windows do not inherit them again. `AGENTSTACK_VAULT`, Codex sandbox/approval flags, and OAuth handling are unchanged.

Legacy roots cannot reliably be distinguished as intentional shared vaults or stale workspace values. New managed launches therefore warn and ignore old `AGENTSTACK_PROTECTED_ROOTS` as configuration. Migrate only deliberate extras to `AGENTSTACK_EXTRA_PROTECTED_ROOTS` (live value, including empty, takes precedence over installed `env.sh`). Finish or release active reservations before migrating and restart affected sessions together, since removing an old root can change relative names. Existing sessions retain their environment until restart. See [migration details](configuration.en.md#reservation-protection-and-migration).

## tmux session

When launched from outside tmux, the launcher creates a new named session and replaces the current terminal tab. From inside tmux, it renames the current session and runs the CLI in place with `exec`.

Matching the session name to the ORRERY Mail identity makes the following associations unambiguous:

- dashboard click-to-jump
- inbox signal delivery target
- transcript / history
- token recovery
- graceful EXIT / RESUME

The shell remains after the terminal process exits so that investigation and scrollback can continue.

## Scientist names

A new identity requested by a top-level launcher has the form `Adjective-Scientist` (hyphenated, for example `Windy-Fermi`). **The read-back from the `register_agent` response is authoritative for the actual registered name**, and some server environments remove the separator or coerce the request to another name. If the requested name differs from the read-back, the launcher explicitly reports the substitution and aligns a not-yet-started top-level session with the read-back name. A reserved / resumed identity that already has a task, token, and inbox attached does not adopt a different name and stops instead.

- adjectives are the 134 words in `bin/lib/agentstack-scientists.sh`
- scientists come from `dashboard/scientist_portraits.json`
- the scientist suffix is the portrait key
- only scientists whose names contain ASCII alphabetic characters are candidates

The 134 words are synchronized word-for-word with ORRERY Mail's canonical `SIMPLE_ADJECTIVES` Round 3 list. Strict ORRERY Mail deployments validate generated names against the canonical list, so do not add a custom word only on the ORRERY Telemetry side.

The launcher, dashboard catalog, suggestion API, and child preregistration share the same adjective and scientist sources. Keeping the naming sources unique prevents drift among portraits, registered names, and server-side validation.

## Name availability and fail-closed behavior

Candidate availability has three states.

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `available` | Confirmed that no identity with the same name exists in the project |
| `occupied` | An identity with the same name exists |
| `unknown` | Cannot be checked because of a transport failure, authentication error, timeout, unavailable database, or similar condition |

`unknown` is not treated as an available name. By default, the launcher's availability probe stops after three consecutive `unknown` results. This fail-closed design prevents acquisition of a potentially conflicting identity during a communication failure.

After the dashboard spawn checks availability on the scientist rail, it validates the full name again through `/api/suggest-name`. It normalizes the specified name by removing `-` and rejects it unless its exact status is `available`. See [Dashboard](dashboard.en.md#new-agent) and [API](api.en.md#post-apispawn) for details.

## Identity registration

The launcher registers an identity with ORRERY Mail before starting the CLI.

1. Remove stale `AGENT_NAME`, `PARENT_AGENT`, token, and reserved marker values
2. Generate a candidate name
3. Check ORRERY Mail health
4. Register with project key, program, model, and task metadata
5. Compare the requested name with the returned canonical name. On a mismatch, a top-level launch reports it and renames the tmux session to the returned name; a reserved identity stops
6. For Codex CLI, record this launch expectation with the numeric agent ID
7. Update the managed agent list and clipboard

If `AGENTSTACK_PROJECT_KEY` is unset or ORRERY Mail is unreachable, the CLI itself still starts with the preselected name. Mail, reservations, and project-scoped dashboard features are unavailable, however.

Claude Code hooks also record registration inside the session. For Codex CLI, `agentstack-codex-bootstrap` handles registration and tmux renaming and also creates a fresh `launch_id` before startup. The official SessionStart hook completes the receipt only after validating the runtime `session_id` against the rollout header. Without that receipt, Codex History does not fall back to a guess.

## Registration token

Reregistering an existing identity requires that identity's `registration_token`. A top-level token is stored with mode `0600`.

```text
${AGENTSTACK_RUNTIME_DIR:-$HOME/.agentstack/runtime}/agent_token_<name>
```

A delegated child additionally has child-owned state at:

```text
${AGENTSTACK_RUNTIME_DIR:-$HOME/.agentstack/runtime}/child-agents/<name>.json
```

The parent's token is not given to a preregistered child. Dashboard spawn generates a child-specific token and passes it to `spawn_child.sh --pre-registered` through a temporary mode-`0600` token file. For Claude / Codex, it accompanies that token with a non-secret `.binding.json` sidecar containing the formal registration response's numeric ID, name, project, and program. The launcher validates both. Both Claude and Codex validate the incoming receipt’s formal ID, name, project, provider and private token before writing canonical files, and consume the handoff only after startup preparation succeeds. Validation failure leaves the handoff and existing canonical credentials/state untouched. Startup failure removes files created by this attempt and restores replaced canonical material from a private undo record. The token stays out of transcripts, command-line arguments, and dashboard responses.

`agentstack-preregister-child` also saves Claude / Codex's formal registration response in the mode-`0600` canonical token and child state above, rather than only in the temporary handoff. Therefore `spawn_child.sh --pre-registered <name> --codex ...` can omit `--child-token-file` and still create a fresh expectation from the token, numeric ID, name, project, and program that came from the same registration. A complete child state may restore a missing canonical token, but the launcher does not guess from corrupt metadata, a project/name/provider mismatch, or token and state from different registrations. For a child that has never started, rerun `agentstack-preregister-child` for the same project, or pass a temporary token and its matching `.binding.json` through `--child-token-file`. Preregistering a child that has already run registers a different name and leaves two agents in the same role. A Claude child from an earlier version (three-field state) is adopted as described in "Migrating Claude children created by older releases" below. A registered Codex child stops before CLI startup when it cannot persist a fresh expectation. Relaunching with `--pre-registered` a child that has run before first asks ORRERY Mail (`whois`) whether it is retired. If it is, the launcher calls `unretire_agent` with the child's own token before starting it, since Mail refuses messages to a retired agent. Mail decides, not the local state, which says nothing after the dashboard's retire button or for an earlier-version child. If the child cannot be made active it is not started, and a failed start retires it again. When Mail cannot be asked and the state does not say retired, it starts with a warning. A fresh preregistration costs no Mail call.

If a launcher is forcibly interrupted and leaves `child-agents/.<name>.registration-pending.json`, this undo record also contains owner credentials and is private mode-`0600` material. Each attempt has a `generation` nonce; an older launcher cannot finalize or restore a newer attempt. Extract only the `generation` field for the command below; do not print the record containing credentials. After the operator confirms that the target tmux / CLI is no longer running, `python3 ~/.agentstack/hooks/child_resume.py finish-registration --runtime-dir <runtime> --agent-name <name> --generation <generation> --rollback` restores the pre-launch canonical material. Do not run it during startup. Explicit and expired-material purge also remove this undo record.

The default `/delegate` path is `--pre-registered --embed-task --task-file <path>`. The parent writes the complete task to a temporary mode-`0600` file, and the launcher embeds it into the first Claude / Codex prompt together with the child name, parent name, spawn time, project key, and instruction to use `send_message` at completion. There is no registration, reregistration, or `fetch_inbox` startup ritual. This prompt is the only source of truth, so do not send the same child a separate task mail. `--task-file` takes precedence over the positional task argument and is also the boundary that prevents the shell from interpreting backticks or `$()` in the task.

`CHILD_REGISTRATION_TOKEN` is a historical variable name, but it is also used to reauthenticate top-level identities.

### Migrating Claude children created by older releases (#140)

Claude children created before 2026.09.30.3 may have a state with only `agent_name`, `project_key`, and `registration_token`. Resume accepts this known format only with an existing exact Claude registration and an already registered owner. Roster checks read the private state/canonical-token match without migrating, registering, or unretiring. An explicit resume authenticates the saved token and verifies the returned numeric ID, exact name, Claude provider, and project ID before migrating to schema 1 and regenerating the child Mail proxy. It does not issue another identity/token or claim an unowned row. Failed authentication refuses startup.

The old state has no retirement timestamp, so migration never infers one from mtime. Successful owner authentication starts a one-time grace period of the configured retention days (30 by default); subsequent normal completion follows the usual retention policy. Retention `0` also refuses legacy migration. Polling never extends an expiry. Incomplete modern states, expired material, tombstones, and pending attempts do not qualify as legacy.

Migration uses a private undo record tied to its nonce. Failed startup preparation restores the old state/MCP config bytes, modes, and mtimes and the original Mail/husk state. A stale rollback after purge or another attempt changes nothing. If forced interruption leaves `child-agents/.<name>.legacy-migration.json`, extract only its `generation` field without printing the record containing credentials. After the operator confirms the target tmux/CLI is stopped, restore the old material with `python3 ~/.agentstack/hooks/child_resume.py finish-legacy-migration --runtime-dir <runtime> --agent-name <name> --generation <generation> --rollback`.

Migration authenticates through bundled Mail's `register_agent(existing_agent_id=...)`, checking only the exact existing ID, name, project, program and owner token. Ordinary registration, name generation and profile updates do not run. An unavailable schema refuses with `config_unrestorable` and update/restart guidance; supported Mail rejecting authentication still returns `credential_missing`. A retrieved schema confirming older Mail selects the conversation-only mode below.

`spawn_child.sh --pre-registered <name>` (Claude, without `--child-token-file`) adopts a three-field legacy state the same way: it passes the same `register_agent(existing_agent_id=...)` check first, then launches under the same name. The ID and program it checks come from `whois`. If the check fails, or Mail has no `existing_agent_id`, it stops without changing the state or token. The adopted state has the same five fields as an ordinary preregistration, and a failed start restores the legacy state from the undo record. Codex children have no legacy migration.

Exiting before migration also preserves the private known three-field state and matching canonical token, including their bytes, modes, and mtimes. Generated MCP config is removed as usual. Cleanup does not guess a formal ID, provider, or retention timestamp; later explicit resume authenticates the owner and migrates. No expiry is inferred before that migration. Invalid legacy permissions, name, token match, or pending checks return an error and preserve the state/token instead of deleting them. Retention `0` remains an explicit opt-out that deletes legacy state/token on exit.

### Resuming a Claude conversation when Mail cannot be restored

A normal `install.sh` update adopts the running Mail deployment without switching its build. A legacy child whose retrieved schema confirms the existing-owner option is absent, a Claude agent whose canonical token file is actually missing, or an agent with safely verified expired retention can resume its terminal and conversation. With supported Mail and valid credentials, the full authentication, migration and unretire path remains in use.

Conversation-only resume returns `resume_mode: conversation_only`, `mail_status: unavailable`, a fixed `mail_reason` (`credential_absent` / `retention_expired` / `mail_schema_unsupported`), and `mail_message` stating that this agent cannot send or receive ORRERY Mail. The DECK chip, NETWORK label/details and an initial terminal line show the warning. `resume_capability: ready` verifies conversation-resume prerequisites; it does not prove successful Mail owner authentication. Before resuming, a row's `resume_mode` (`mail` / `conversation_only`) in `/api/agents` / `/api/graph` says which one it will be.

This mode uses an empty `--strict-mcp-config` and `--settings '{"disableAllHooks":true}'` to suppress ordinary user/project/plugin MCP and hooks. Other MCP servers and hooks are also unavailable for this launch. A tmux-session `AGENTSTACK_MAIL_DISABLED=1` prevents product automatic registration, cleanup, reservation hooks and watcher notifications. State/token files are not migrated, removed or overwritten, and Mail registration, claim, unretire and retire do not run. Notification signals remain unread. Ordinary registration is never substituted for existing-owner authentication on older Mail.

Before classifying absence or expiry, existing material is checked for UID, mode, regular-file type, identity, token agreement and pending attempts. Empty/invalid tokens, authentication rejection, mismatch, unsafe files/symlinks, corrupt state/config, another identity, pending attempts and explicit purge refuse startup. A failed schema request is not evidence of older Mail. Resuming an expired conversation does not renew Mail retention. Restoring Mail requires the [Mail update procedure](agentstack-mail-update.md) or an operator credential-recovery decision; do not substitute registration or enrollment from the conversation.

## Reregistration

```bash
AGENTSTACK_PROJECT_KEY=/path/to/project \
  ~/.agentstack/bin/agentstack-reregister "$AGENT_NAME"
```

The helper reads the owner token from runtime state and restores the identity with the same name. Do not create a different name when same-name registration fails. A different name separates the inbox, thread, reservations, and audit history.

`agentstack-reregister` consumes an existing token; it does not issue one. For a parentless bot that never passed through a launcher, an initial claim of a `server-null` row, or explicit recovery after the exact `stage=local-token reason=credential-unavailable` diagnostic, an operator—not the model—follows [Persistent-agent enrollment and startup](persistent-agents.en.md). Ordinary restarts do not repeat enrollment.

## Persistent parentless agents

A bot that reuses the same identity after restart can run through an `agentstack-persistent` profile. The profile keeps provider, parentless status, persistent lifecycle, and interactive/headless mode in separate fields. It `exec`s the command only after matching the saved credential, Mail authority, and numeric row. It never enrolls automatically or creates an alias. Interactive Claude preserves the normal `--channels plugin:...` selector, inspects a finite set of effective configuration sources including `.mcp.json` files from the working directory through the filesystem root, current checkout-local settings for normal/separate-gitdir repositories, main-checkout local settings for linked worktrees, and installed plugins resolved through the effective inventory / marketplace registry / catalog, and replaces only standalone Mail aliases with same-named bound overlays. Unsupported plugin or managed configuration and unreadable effective sources are rejected before startup rather than guessed.

[Persistent-agent enrollment and startup](persistent-agents.en.md) is the operational source of truth for new bots, migration of existing bots, credential recovery, Claude Channels PTY preservation, headless bridges, and a second Mail instance or machine.

## `CLAUDECODE` guard

The launcher and child spawner set the following in each tmux session's environment:

```text
CLAUDECODE=1
```

This guard prevents an interactive shell's exit hook from cascading into termination of the entire tmux server.

The value is set with `tmux new-session -e` when the session is created, not in the tmux server's global environment, so that identities from other sessions cannot mix.

## Dashboard Claude resume

Normally completed Claude children retain mode-`0600` state and their owner credential for 30 days by default. The dashboard verifies the original project, numeric ID, name, program, credential, expiry, and permissions. It regenerates the child-owned Mail proxy configuration, re-registers the same identity using the saved credential, and calls `unretire_agent` to restore delivery before opening a terminal. A running child resume is protected from expiry purge and runs cleanup again when its CLI exits. Top-level Claude sessions use the same registration and unretire sequence when their existing owner token is available. The resumed session's SessionStart hook re-registers from the shell with the registered model (or `claude-code` when none is registered), handed as `CLAUDE_CHILD_MODEL`, never a model left in the tmux server environment. `AGENTSTACK_CLAUDE_MODEL` is left alone, so agents launched from that session keep their default model. For a top-level session (an owner token without child state) whose registration response confirmed that it was previously retired, a normal CLI exit re-retires it in Mail with the same token (a tmux kill or SIGHUP skips this). Reservations are left to the session's SessionEnd hook. Nothing is retired while the identity is live in another session: a tmux pane other than this one whose pane metadata names it, a running CLI behind a SessionStart lease under `runtime/live-sessions/<name>/<pid>` (the next SessionStart removes leases whose CLI has ended), or a pane list that cannot be read from inside tmux. The token is kept for the next resume, and an originally active identity is not retired.

A session reopened from a terminal with `claude --resume` is unretired on the same terms, but only when the SessionStart source is `startup` or `resume`; on `/clear` or compaction a retirement made while the session ran stands, and the session is told it is retired: its SessionStart shell registration authenticates the saved owner credential, and when Mail reports the row retired it unretires only retained child state (within its period, same token, no resume in progress) or an owner token with neither child state nor a tombstone. Legacy three-field state, expired or purged material stays retired, with a one-line note to resume from the dashboard.

Credentials deleted by an older cleanup return `credential_missing`; expired material returns `retention_expired`, and explicitly purged material returns `purged`. Resume refuses startup and never registers an alias or issues a credential. Any necessary recovery is an operator procedure described in [Persistent-agent enrollment and startup](persistent-agents.en.md). Failed Mail registration, unretire, or child proxy restoration also prevents Claude startup. Startup preparation creates a temporary detached tmux session and gates the CLI with `tmux wait-for`. Only after window opening and session-name replacement succeed does it release the CLI and dispose of the old husk. Failure removes the temporary session, preserves the original shell, and re-retires Mail only when the registration response confirmed that the identity was previously retired. An originally active identity is never retired as compensation. Failures of the restoration itself are explicitly reported in `rollback_errors`.

## Codex-specific startup

`agent-start-codex` performs the following steps.

- source `agentstack-codex-bootstrap` for registration and renaming
- fix the working directory with `codex -C <dir>`
- pass `--sandbox ${AGENTSTACK_CODEX_SANDBOX:-workspace-write}`
- pass `--ask-for-approval ${AGENTSTACK_CODEX_APPROVAL:-on-request}`
- pass `--add-dir` only when `AGENTSTACK_VAULT` exists
- remove `OPENAI_API_KEY` and prefer ChatGPT OAuth

Dashboard Codex resume also always sources the same installer-distributed `agentstack-codex-bootstrap`, re-registers the reserved identity, and creates a fresh resume launch before it execs `codex resume`. It does not depend on a personal wrapper under `~/.codex/bin`; a bootstrap, prepare, or unretire failure prevents resume from starting. Top-level resumes also call unretire.

A fresh Codex child launch records `launch_origin: child` and its selected `codex_mcp_profile` in the launch expectation. Top-level Codex sessions started by `cx` / `agent-start-codex` or the persistent launcher record `launch_origin: standalone` and carry no child profile. After the official `SessionStart` verifies identity and rollout, that non-secret provenance is copied into the bound session receipt with the numeric agent ID, project, and provider. The receipt remains outside private resume state, credentials, and the isolated home, so the dashboard can distinguish a cleaned-up child, a product-launched top-level session, and a session with unknown origin. A receipt created before provenance existed is not assigned an origin from its name or history and cannot resume.

Normal cleanup releases reservations, retires the remote identity, and deletes the child home, proxy runtime, and old MCP configuration. State carrying its schema, `retired_at`, and `resume_expires_at`, plus the canonical credential, is retained for 30 days by default (`AGENTSTACK_CHILD_RESUME_RETENTION_DAYS=0` restores full deletion). Dashboard resume matches the receipt, formal project, numeric agent ID, name, private state / credential, expiry, and permissions, then builds a new child home from the saved `codex_mcp_profile` and current source Codex home. It never reuses an old home or proxy-runtime snapshot.

Resume bootstrap uses the retained credential to re-register the same identity, writes a fresh binding expectation, and only then un-retires the remote identity. Unretire is the last operation before `codex resume`; earlier failures discard generated artifacts while preserving both the credential and retired state. An unretire failure also prevents Codex startup. Cleanup after a resumed run leaves a new provenance-bearing receipt and re-retains private material, so the same child can be resumed repeatedly.

In the interactive TUI of `codex-cli 0.154.0` and `0.156.1`, measurement showed the resume `SessionStart` hook firing after the first submitted user message, not while the composer remained idle. Resume bootstrap compares the dashboard-selected session ID with both the existing receipt and rollout header, then retains that receipt's exact `launch_id` / `receipt_id` as history authority only while the fresh resume expectation is unclaimed and non-conflicted. The same session can therefore be resumed again after exiting without a prompt. After the first submit, the official payload replaces the fallback with a fresh receipt only when its session ID matches both the pinned ID and header; a different ID, a conflict, or the next startup expectation invalidates the fallback. This timing statement is limited to the measured versions and is not a general guarantee for other versions or modes.

The SessionStart recorder writes JSONL timing records for lock acquisition, rollout-header validation, the launch transition, the receipt write, and the final outcome to `$AGENTSTACK_RUNTIME_DIR/codex-session-binding.log`. It does not record session IDs, launch nonces, transcript paths, or credentials. A `started` event without a matching `outcome` distinguishes a hook that was terminated in flight. The SessionStart hook deadline is five seconds so a cold start or brief lock wait does not interrupt receipt creation.

Because an API key in the environment can override OAuth, it is removed only from the Codex subprocess.

## Mail watcher and REPL injection

When the mail watcher finds an ORRERY Mail signal, it injects notification text into the corresponding tmux session's Claude / Codex REPL.

Text and submission are separate operations.

```bash
tmux send-keys -t "$session" -l "$text"
sleep 0.2
tmux send-keys -t "$session" C-m
```

Codex may not treat the `Enter` keysym as submission, so the watcher uses `C-m`. It avoids accidental injection into a bare shell and runs tmux calls in workers with timeouts.

## Skills (2) and file reservations

The installer places the following skills in the canonical `~/.agentstack/skills` directory and creates absolute symlinks from Claude Code's standard discovery path, `~/.claude/skills/<name>`, to each canonical copy.

- [`/delegate`](../skills/delegate/SKILL.md): declare and reserve resources, then launch and monitor a Claude / Codex child with an optional model and worktree
- [`/log`](../skills/log/SKILL.md): organize session decisions, changes, verification, and next actions into a reusable Markdown log

A Claude Code session that was open before installation does not discover the newly added skills. Run `/exit` once and relaunch with `agent-start <project>` from a new terminal.

### `/delegate`

`/delegate` is not merely a shortcut that launches a child.

ORRERY Telemetry delegation must be entered with the leading slash as `/delegate ...`. `delegate ...` is an ordinary prompt, not an invocation of this skill. If Claude handles it with a built-in subagent / Agent tool, it may produce an artifact, but it does not create ORRERY Telemetry identity, reservations, a dedicated tmux session, or dashboard telemetry. Do not use the built-in Agent tool in place of `/delegate` when the objective is to create an ORRERY Telemetry-monitored child.

| Item | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Trigger | A request to delegate to a child, launch a subagent, or perform parallel work |
| Basic form | `/delegate "<task>" [--dir <path>] [--codex] [--model <model>] [--codex-mcp <inherit\|orrery-only>] [--worktree] [--worktree-base <rev>] [--claude-chrome \| --claude-chrome-device <id>] [--base <default\|mail-only>] [--tools <spec>]...` |
| Required prerequisites | The parent's ORRERY Mail identity and canonical project key. Editing tasks require a resource declaration and reservation |
| Optional prerequisites | `--worktree` requires a Git repository; dashboard annotation requires the dashboard service |

The parent agent does not finish when it hands off the task. It remains responsible for deciding scope and risk, making reservations, monitoring, and verifying the artifact. Use `--codex` for a Codex child, `--model` for an allowed model, and `--dir` to choose the child's working directory.

`--base mail-only` and `--tools browser[:<deviceId>]` / `screen[:read|:operate]` / `screen:<read|operate>:<server>` / `mcp:<server>[:all]` choose the tools a child gets. A child with a selection is not started when the selection cannot be applied ([Choosing the tools a child gets](delegation.en.md#choosing-the-tools-a-child-gets---base----tools)).

Codex children default to MCP profile `inherit` for backward compatibility. `/delegate --codex-mcp orrery-only` keeps authenticated ORRERY Mail and the session-binding plugin while disabling other inherited MCP servers and plugins. Do not use it for tasks that require plugin skills or external app tools.

Claude generation names live in `spawn_child.sh`; Codex model and effort policy lives in `dashboard/codex_models.py`. For Claude, an omitted model or `opus` means `claude-opus-5-5`, and `sonnet` means `claude-sonnet-5`; for Codex, omission and explicit `sol` both mean `gpt-6.1-sol` when the selected CLI is 0.159.0 or later (fresh catalog evidence is used if its version is unknown), otherwise `gpt-6-sol`. GPT-6.1 Sol requires Codex CLI 0.159.0 or later; doctor reports fallback and update guidance. Use a formal ID such as `gpt-6-sol` to pin the prior generation. `claude-opus-5` / `opus-5` remain valid compatibility forms for explicitly requesting the prior generation. `luna` means `gpt-6-luna`, `terra` means `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `astra` means `gpt-6-astra`. Full IDs for older generations remain valid for compatibility. Pre-registered Claude children always cold-start; a running warm-pool process cannot adopt the newly selected workspace and reservation roots. Startup therefore includes normal CLI initialization rather than warm-pool reuse; no fixed startup time is guaranteed. Opus 5.5 requires Claude Code 2.1.280 or later.

1. Determine risk and monitoring cadence from the target resources, exclusivity, failure points, and reversibility
2. Create a child-owned token and canonical name with `agentstack-preregister-child`
3. Prepare the file reservation, contact, and mode-`0600` canonical task file
4. Launch Claude / Codex with its model and worktree through `spawn_child.sh --embed-task --task-file` (do not send task mail)
5. Read the ORRERY Mail completion report and `monitor_child_agent.sh`, then verify the artifact yourself
6. Release the reservation before reporting the parent's result

A worktree child's cwd changes to `${AGENTSTACK_WORKTREE_ROOT:-$AGENTSTACK_HOME/worktrees}/<name>` (normally `~/.agentstack/worktrees/<name>`), but its ORRERY Mail project does not change. The task must identify `AGENTSTACK_PROJECT_KEY` / `PROJECT_KEY` as canonical. `--worktree-base <rev>` fixes the baseline for multiple children. Existing `/tmp/cc-worktrees` entries are not migrated; only new spawns use the persistent root.

The monitor's dangerous-command detection is passive by default. When enabled with `AGENTSTACK_MONITOR_DANGER_CHECK=1`, a match causes a soft stop. Repeated stasis with unchanged output escalates through soft stop, `C-c`, process-group freeze, then session kill regardless of that setting. See the skill text for the exit codes.

### `/log`

| Item | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Trigger | A request to create a session log, summarize current work, or save decisions, changes, and verification |
| Basic form | `/log <theme> [project]` |
| Required prerequisites | A theme. Ask only when the project is not obvious and cannot be inferred safely |
| Optional prerequisites | Obsidian mode requires `AGENTSTACK_OBSIDIAN_APP` and an `AGENTSTACK_PROJECT_KEY` inside the vault |

`/log` uses Obsidian mode only when `AGENTSTACK_OBSIDIAN_APP` and `AGENTSTACK_PROJECT_KEY` are both set and the project is inside the vault. It connects to existing project `logs/` and daily-note conventions when present, and does not guess a private directory structure when no convention is found.

Otherwise, it writes to:

```text
<git-root-or-cwd>/logs/LOG_<YYYY-MM-DDTHHmm> <Theme>.md
```

The log is not a transcript. It focuses on Goal, Decisions, Work Performed, Verification, Related Notes, and Next Actions.

### Hooks and reservation enforcement

Claude Code hard-blocks `Edit` / `Write` through the `check-file-reservation.sh` PreToolUse hook. Codex has no equivalent hook, so the managed `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` instructs reserve / renew / release discipline. The registry is shared, so Claude and Codex reservations are mutually visible.

See [Hooks and operational helpers](hooks.en.md) for the trigger timing, caller, block conditions, and cleanup lifecycle of the repository's 11 hooks / helpers.
