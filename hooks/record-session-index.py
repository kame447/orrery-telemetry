"""record-session-index.py

Called from mark-agent-registered.sh (PostToolUse on register_agent).

Records a precise, unambiguous mapping so the agent-dashboard can resume the
EXACT Claude session belonging to an ORRERY Mail row — instead of guessing via
name self-reference scoring + an mtime activity window (which mis-fires when
`last_active_ts` is stuck at inception, or when a name is reused across
projects; see logs/ in the dashboard project).

Key = ORRERY Mail `id` (global PRIMARY KEY → unique per session). For each
register_agent we write:

    ~/.agentstack/runtime/session_index/<agent_id>.json
        {agent_id, agent_name, session_id, transcript_path, cwd, ts}

Idempotent re-registration / resume keeps the same id and session_id, so we
simply overwrite (keeps the entry fresh). The dashboard reads this first and
only falls back to the heuristic for old sessions registered before this hook
existed.

Reads the PostToolUse hook payload (JSON) on stdin. Never raises — a failure
here must not disturb registration.
