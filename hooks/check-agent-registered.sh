#
#   1. does more than one identity claim this session? Acting as either would
#      misattribute the work, and this guard covers Bash, which can write any
#      file -- leaving the check to the Edit/Write guard leaves it exploitable.
#   2. can anyone register right now, i.e. is the service answering? While it
#      is not, a refusal demands something nobody can do.
#   3. does this session have an identity source?
#
# The first two used to sit behind "no AGENT_NAME and no flag", which made them
# checks about how a session was launched rather than about what is true.
