# 3. A session that registered without a launcher still has an identity: the
# PostToolUse hook on register_agent wrote it into the session index. Clients
# that start Claude Code directly (an IDE panel, the desktop app) never get
# AGENT_NAME and are not inside tmux, so without this they look anonymous even
# after registering, and the reservation guard has nothing to check against.
#
# Two rules keep this from becoming a way to borrow someone else's name:
#
#   one binding      a session that has been recorded under more than one name
#                    is a conflict, not a rename. Nothing here guesses which is
#                    current -- ordering by timestamp would let whichever record
#                    happens to sort last take over the identity.
#   same project     agent names are project-local, so a binding is authority
#                    only inside the project it was made in. The caller passes
#                    the project it is about to act on.
